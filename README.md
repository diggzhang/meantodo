##nodemon
Automatically restart server when files change: By default, node will not monitor for file changes after your server has been started. This means you’d have to shut down and start the server every time you made a file change. This can be fixed with nodemon. To use: install nodemon globally npm install -g nodemon. Start your server with nodemon server.js now. Smooth sailing from there.
